DESCRIPTION: Jimothy came back to his computer after lunch and logged in to see some processes running he didn't open. 
He saw a note on the desktop saying something about him being hacked. He called IT and they were able to grab a memory 
dump of the device before they asked Jimothy to unplug the machine. Can you figure out what the attackers were doing on the machine?

This challenge is rooted in Windows digital forensics, and to help us we
downloaded the volitility tool from
https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3

First we extracted the .raw file from the provided zip archive. 
I opened it to see what it looked like, which was a bad idea, and I had to close my
terminal so that I could actually start doing the challenge. 

First we ran a command to see all the running processes at the time of the dump, 
to try and see if there was anything suspicious running: 

	python3 ./volatility3/vol3 -f memory_dump.raw windows.pslist.PsList
	
This gave us a whole list of sketchy-looking Windows background processes and drivers,
but it also had a process called mimikatz, which is a famous exploit used to get
passwords from users. We noted down its process id (8096)

We then ran a memory dump on the process itself:
	python3 ./volatility3/vol3 -f memory_dump.raw Windows.memmap --pid 8096 --dump

And then stringified it so that it could be read with people-eyes:
	strings pid_8096.dmp | less

Within that file we found a ransom note! It means we're on the right track. 
	| en your precious company data!
	| If you want it back, send $1,000,000 worth of Cthulhu Offerings (OFF) to the following address:
	| miH7CvSGyutSFtQB6w3AshXaDjbuqktXUQ
	| The flag is the ntlm hash of the user wrapped.
	| Ex: flag{31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0}
	
So we know we're looking for poor Jimothy's ntlm password hash. Thankfully, volitility
has a function for that:
	python3 ./volatility3/vol.py -f memory_dump.raw hashdump

This got us the hashes for all the users:

Wrapping Jimothy's in the flag wrapper gets us the flag: osu{80a1850fba580325595eb75c2ec50207}
