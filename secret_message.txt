DESCRIPTION: A secret message has been sent to you through this image, can you demonstrate your 'hackerman' skills and find the flag?

A delightful image, first of all.
This is a short little forensics challenge with image shenanigans. First we downloaded
the image to get a closer look at it. 

Running binwalk on the .jpg file showed us that it was hiding a zip archive inside it,
containing enc.py and flag.enc, both of which look like things we want to look at. 

Extracting the zip file, we see that it is password protected. No big deal, let's look
at the hex representation of the image, maybe it's got some answers for us. 

Using HexEd.it, we loaded the image to poke around. The beginning magic bytes look legit --
it's a jpg alright. But jpg images also have traling bytes -- FF D9 -- so let's see if
there's anything fun AFTER those. 

We get the line: s3tY8_C1g4m=drowssap
That looks a litt;s suspicious; it looks even more suspicious after we realised that 
drowssap is password backwards. By that convention, m4g1C_8Yt3s is the password, which
spells out magic bytes! How convenient.

Unzipping the file successfully, we see that the script takes flag.txt and XORs it with
the image data, using it as a one-time pad. That's super easy to reverse -- just run it 
again on the encrypted flag!

(slight mishap with the image aside) we can copy flag.enc to flag.txt, then run the script to
get our flag!

Who's the hackerman now!
